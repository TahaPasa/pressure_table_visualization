# proje.py
Proje.py is A basic matplotlib script that generates random number (in my case I've connected arduino and got datas from it) and shows it on propper heatmap

# ardu.py
Gets data from arduino with 1 second intervals and shows it on heatmap.

# Note:
Arduino data comes with 225-length integer values that widened to comma-separated string.
