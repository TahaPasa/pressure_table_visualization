# proje.py
Proje.py is A basic matplotlib script that generates random numbers (in my case I've connected Arduino and got datas from it) and shows it on proper heatmap

# ardu.py
Gets data from Arduino with 1-second intervals and shows it on the heatmap.

# Example Image:
Someone standing on a pressure table:

# Note:
Arduino data comes with 225-length integer values that widened to comma-separated string.
